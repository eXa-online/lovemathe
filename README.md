## PWA \(Progressive Web App\)

One feature of lovemathe is the available option to install the game as a PWA on your device.

### Features

PWA makes lovemathe run with higher performance, especially in networks with lower bandwidth. Once installed correctly, you can play lovemathe even without any internet connection.

### Installation

Using a mobile browser, you usually get a pop up asking, whether to install lovemathe to your device:

Otherwise you can use the Chrome dropdown:

Please note, that Safari offers almost no support for PWA's.

If you want to try out the PWA on your desktop device, you have a button in the Chrome URL bar on Windows:
